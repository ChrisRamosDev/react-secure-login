# GatsbyJS Secure Login!

## A secure login page using Gatsby / Auth0

## Deployed on Netlify

I wanted to try to make a gatsby app that utilizes Auth0 for a secure login using
usernames / passwords. It directs the user to auth0 for login / signup. It displays
the users name if available and allows the user to visit certain links only when
logged in.

### TODO:

- style app
- add content to pages
